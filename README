This project - currently called Tritious, but that will likely change in the
future - is a fairly simple browser-based game engine with a AppEngine/Python
backend (server/ folder) and an Ember.js front-end that uses ember-cli
(client/ folder).

It's still in the early stages of development, so stay tuned!
